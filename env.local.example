# EmailJS Configuration
# To set up the contact form with EmailJS:
# 1. Go to https://emailjs.com and create a free account
# 2. Create an email service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
# 3. Create an email template
# 4. Get your Service ID, Template ID, and Public Key
# 5. Add them below:

NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_xxxxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_xxxxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Note: These are public keys (NEXT_PUBLIC_) so they're safe to expose in the browser
# Add .env.local to your .gitignore file
